;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Play Glean from Guile or Geiser (in Emacs).  Currently, to use, start the
;; client as usual, then connect to the default Guile REPL server, and enter
;; this module.
;;
;;; Code:

(define-module (glean client components repl-client-core)
  #:use-module (glean config)
  #:use-module (glean client monadic-min)
  #:use-module (glean common components)
  #:use-module (glean common monads)
  #:use-module (glean common utils)
  #:use-module (ice-9 match)
  #:use-module (rnrs)
  #:export (component))

;;;;; Preliminaries
;;;
;;; Really, when launched from the command line, using the usual launch
;;; sequence for the client, this should fire up a REPL at the shell prompt.
;;; Instead, currently, the user is forced to connect to the spawned server
;;; and 'enter' this module.  This renders the client launch sequence rather
;;; useless.
;;;
;;; I have not gotten around to figuring out how to do this yetâ€¦
