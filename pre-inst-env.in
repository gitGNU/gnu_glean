# Run COMMAND in a pre-installation environment.  Typical use is, e.g.,

# By default we may end up with absolute directory names that contain '..',
# which get into $GUILE_LOAD_PATH, leading to '..' in the module file names
# recorded by Guile.  To avoid that, make sure we get a real absolute
# directory name.
