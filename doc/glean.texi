@chapter Installation

Glean is available for download from its website at
@url{http://glean.somewhere/}.  This section describes the software
requirements of Glean, as well as how to install it and get ready
to use it.

The build procedure for Glean is the same as for other GNU software, and
is not covered here.  Please see the files @file{README} and
@file{INSTALL} in the Glean source tree for additional details.

@node Requirements
@section Requirements

Glean depends on the following packages:

@itemize
@item @url{http://gnu.org/software/guile/, GNU Guile}, version 2.0.5 or later;
@item @url{http://gnupg.org/, GNU libgcrypt}
@end itemize

In addition, if you want to run the standard Glean web client (UI)
then you'll need to install Artanis.  A version comes bundled with
Glean, and it can be installed by simply copying it to the usual
Guile site directory. See below for getting the web client up and
running.
