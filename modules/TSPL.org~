* Commentary:
An attempt to write a module in org-mode (plain text) to assess its feasibility.
The module is based on R. Kent Dybvig's The Scheme Programming Language (need permission before publication).
It will follow the individual chapters in its 'story mode', but will build on the reference section in Chapter 6.
Guilecraft tags in this module represent the same procedure, asked about in different manners. 
This module is hand-crafted.
