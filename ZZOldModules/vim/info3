help_title="Splitting screens and hiding buffers"

help_short="This level will teach you how to use the split screen and buffers functionality."
help_long="You can use the split screen functionality to view and edit several files at the same time. You can also hide active files without having to quit them so you can edit a different file before writing. This is done through the buffer commands. The two commands will allow you to work on projects that consist of several files at the same time, or to work on the same file at different places simultaniously.\n(Don't insert blank spaces between key-combinations and arguments)"

# There are some duplicate commands here like using arrow keys and buffers and ls
# Ideally I also want to change ctrl-W to the actual key combination as opposed to typing it to
# allow the user to practice it.
