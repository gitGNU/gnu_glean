help_title="Learning to program with Python"
help_short="This module helps you to learn how to prgram using Python. It is loosely based on Beginning Python by James Payne in that it follows it's chapter structure. The first three chapters are hence a more general introduction to programming.\n"
help_long="In each level you will learn about a different built-in or function call in Python. You will then be given a short quiz that allows you to practice what you've learned.\n The further you get the more Python levels will be unlocked that you can then play for highscores.\n There is no time limit in this module and you will only be asked to answer each question correctly once.\n"
