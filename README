The goals of the Glean project are:

  - to provide a highly personal learning environment;

  - that is nonetheless capable to build on collaborative content
    contributions;

  - which provides the means to build hierarchies of content;

  - that is deployable in different ways (web service, self-hosted, single
    executable…);

  - to provide as core content modules that allow users to grok their GNU
    system and the core GNU components.

* Warning

Glean 0.1 must very much be considered a technology preview, and highly
experimental. Whilst it is possible to use this version to create basic
disciplines, and to practise these, I make no guarantees for backward
compatibility of either your progress or the discipline format for version
0.2.

To avoid disappointment I would recommend waiting for 0.2.  If you feel
adventurous — please go ahead and contact me if you run into trouble!

* Requirements

Glean currently depends on the following packages:

  - [[http://gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile 2.0.x]], version 2.0.5 or later
