;; Commentary:
;;
;; A library providing a basic convenience layer between bootstrap and sxml. I
;; envisage procedures from this library to provide bootstrap building blocks,
;; which can be composed and combined to form individual pages of wildly
;; differing formats.
;;
;; Code:

(define-module (guilecraft clients web bootstrap)
  #:use-module (artanis artanis)
  #:use-module (guilecraft clients monadic-min)
  #:use-module (guilecraft config)
  #:use-module (guilecraft data-types base-requests)
  #:use-module (guilecraft data-types sets)
  #:use-module (guilecraft monads)
  #:use-module (guilecraft utils)
  #:use-module (ice-9 match)
  #:use-module (sxml simple)
  #:use-module (web uri)
  #:export (web-client))
